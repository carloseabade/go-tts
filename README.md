# go-tts

`go-tts` is a Go module that enables you to utilize Microsoft Edge's online text-to-speech service. It is inspired by [edge-tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) and forked from [edge-tts-go](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts).

## Installation

You can download and install the packages by looking the [releases](https://github.com/carloseabade/go-tts/releases) or by running:

```bash
$ go install github.com/carloseabade/go-tts/cmd/go-tts@latest
$ go install github.com/carloseabade/go-tts/cmd/go-playback@latest
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

To use `go-tts`, execute the following command:

```bash
$ go-tts -text "Hello, world!" -write-media hello.mp3
```

**Note**: You can always use `-help` to learn about all the available options.

If you wish to play it back immediately, you can use the `go-playback` command:

```bash
$ go-playback -text "Hello, world!"
```

All `go-tts` commands are compatible with `go-playback` as well.

**Note**: Keep in mind that `go-playback` is intended for playback only. If you want to save a file, you need to explicitly use `-write-media`, otherwise, it will only play the speech and remove the temporary downloaded files. This is different from `go-tts`, which will always download a file.

### Changing the voice

If you wish to change the voice language, follow these steps:

You can check the available voices with the `-list-voices` option:

```bash
$ go-tts -list-voices

Gender: Female
Locale: pt-BR
...
$ go-tts -voice pt-BR-AntonioNeural -text "Ol√°, mundo!" -write-media hello_in_portuguese.mp3
```

### Changing rate and volume

You can make minor adjustments to the generated speech.

```bash
$ go-tts -rate -50% -text "Hello, world!" -write-media hello_with_rate_halved.mp3
$ go-tts -volume -50% -text "Hello, world!" -write-media hello_with_volume_halved.mp3
```
